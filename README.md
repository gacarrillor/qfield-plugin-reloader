# QField Plugin Reloader

QField plugin that allows you to reload your chosen (app) plugin **in one click**.

Particularly handy when developing a QField plugin and needing to quickly reload it (i.e., unload it and load it again) to reflect latests changes made to plugin files.



### Installation

You can **install QField plugins via URL**, see how in the [QField plugin documentation](https://docs.qfield.org/how-to/plugins/#application-plugins).

You can use the following URL to install the **latest QField Plugin Reloader version**: https://github.com/gacarrillor/qfield-plugin-reloader/releases/latest/download/qfield-plugin-reloader.zip



### How to use it

Once installed, the plugin will add a button to the QField's **main plugin toolbar**. If you click on it, you'll see a toast displayed telling you to **first configure the plugin** by pressing and holding.

When doing so, a pop-up dialog will be shown, where you can **choose the application plugin you'd like to be reloaded**. You can change the chosen plugin whenever you want. Needless to say, you need to have at least another application plugin installed in your QField application.

After this configuration, you can click on the QField Plugin Reloader button (main QField plugin toolbar), and accept the confirmation dialog to trigger a reload of the plugin you chose in the previous step.



### FAQ

##### I'm developing a *project* plugin and not an *application* one. How can I reload it?

You can reload project plugins by reloading the QField project.
